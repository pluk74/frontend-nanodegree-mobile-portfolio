## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).


####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Starting PageSpeed Insights scores:

| Mobile        | Desktop     | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| 27      | 29 | 

Results:

| Modification | New mobile score | Mobile score change | New desktop score | Desktop score change|
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Optimize images and resize pizzeria.jpg for index.html | 73 | +46 | 88 | +59 |
| Switch to Webfont loader (asynchronous) | 77 | +4 | 90| +2 |
| Add async to google-analytics js | 77 | 0 | 90| 0 |
| Switch to inline CSS for index.html | 88 | +11 | 94 | +4 |
| Media query for print.css | 95 | +7 | 94 | 0 |

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).
